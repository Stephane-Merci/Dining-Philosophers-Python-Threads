## Key Features:

Thread-Based Philosophers: Each philosopher is represented by a thread, simulating concurrent actions.
Semaphore Synchronization: Semaphores ensure safe access to shared resources (forks) and prevent deadlocks.
Clear Code Structure: Well-organized code with comments for easy understanding.

## Getting Started:

Clone the repository.
Run the code with Python: python dining_philosophers.py
Observe the philosophers' actions as they think, eat, and try to acquire forks.

## Learn More:

Examine the code to grasp thread management and semaphore usage.
Experiment with different numbers of philosophers and execution times.
Witness potential deadlocks under certain conditions.
This project provides hands-on experience with synchronization challenges in concurrent programming!
